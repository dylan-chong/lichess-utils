## lichess-board-speaker

- add this script using using tampermonkey / userscripts (safari)
- on lichess.org
    - enable keyboard move input
    - you'll probably want to enable move narration
    - go to a puzzle
    - turn on blindfold mode
- type into the move input box `pcs [wk|wq|bk|bq|a]` to read out pieces on the white-kingside quadrant, white-queenside quadrant, ..., or all pieces 
    - the 'invalid input' sound plays when you type, but just ignore that sound
- profit from blindfold chess puzzle practice!
